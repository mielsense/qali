/**

 * `cursor-expired`; a 409 and a Graph `ErrorItemAlreadyExists` both become
 * `conflict`.

  | "not-found" // the target calendar/event does not exist
  | "conflict" // a write collided (e.g. duplicate idempotency key)
  | "cursor-expired" // an opaque sync cursor is no longer valid — full resync

 * double-book (this is the whole reason the write path carries an idempotency
 * key — see the port's `reconcileAmbiguousCreate`).
