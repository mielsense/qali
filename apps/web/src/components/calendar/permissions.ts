 * `(event) => EventCapabilities`, with the user's calendars loaded so each
 * event can be judged against the access role of the calendar it lives on.
 *
 * The rules themselves live in the backend's `lib/permissions`, which the
 * server enforces independently — this hook only decides what to *offer*.
 *
 * Modelled on `useEventColor`: the calendar list is a separate subscription
 * rather than something bolted onto the event query, so the event rows stay
 * referentially stable (the drag override and `useStableQuery` both depend on
 * that). Convex dedupes the subscription, so calling this in several places is
 * free.
